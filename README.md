Welcome on my Portfolio, can run it by using npm run start!

It is way too complicated for what it is, but I wanted to pratice few things:
Using React useContext and useReducer hooks together with typeScript.

I'm using for the first time lint-staged that runs a prettier before commiting, very pleasant.
I'm using styled component for styling.
